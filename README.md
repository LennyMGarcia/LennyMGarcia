# Welcome to LennyMGarcia's Profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I'm Lenny, a passionate **Fullstack Developer** with expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, and a variety of exciting frameworks and libraries, including React.js, Node.js, Next.js, Nest.js, and ASP.NET. I also dive deep into relational and non-relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MariaDB, MongoDB, and ElasticSearch.  

I'm driven by a strong curiosity to explore new technologies and constantly challenge myself to become a better developer. Currently, my focus is on **web development**, **data sciences**, and **cybersecurity**, but I'm always open to learning more and pushing the boundaries of what I can do. 

âœ¨ **What I bring to the table**  
As someone who thrives on problem-solving and continuous learning, I'm not just about writing codeâ€”I'm about understanding the big picture, crafting efficient solutions, and ensuring a great user experience.
